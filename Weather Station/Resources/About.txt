This is a Ardunio Uno(Atmega328p-Microcontroller) based "Digital Weather Station" Project.
                      
----------------------------MICROPROCESSOR AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS--------------------------


Sensors/Equipments:

       BMP280 sensor for measuring accurate (Temperature, Air-Pressure and Altitude).
       DHT11 sensor for Humidity measurement.
       LDR sensor for Light persentage measurement.
       20X4 LCD Display with I2c Module for showing data.
       Arduino Uno Board.
       Breadboard and connecting wires.
       

Functionality:

      Temperature measured in (Celcious, Farenheight and Kelvin) scale.
      Air Pressure measured in (Pascal, KiloPascal and bar) scale.
      Altitude measurement from sea level.
      Humidity measurement.
      Light persentage measurement.
      Weather Prediction (Sunny, Cloudy and Rainy).

User Guide:

      1. Firstly, click "Upload(.Hex)" button.
      2. Make sure to disconnect Arduino for a few moment.
      3. Browse the necessary files(Programmer.exe, ChipConfig.conf and Weather_Station_G-5.ino.standard.hex).
      4. Then click "Find Port" button to detect Communication Port With Arduino Board.
      5. Reconnect the Arduino within 30 seconds after clicking "Ok" Pop-Up button.
      6. Then simply Click "Flash" button to upload the Code in Arduino.
      7. Once flashed, the Arduino will run and display the data accurately.
