ATmega microcontrollers are a family of 8-bit microcontrollers developed by Atmel(now part of Microchip Technology). 
These microcontrollers are based on the AVR architecture, which is designed for high performance and low power 
consumption. They are widely used in embedded systems due to their versatility, ease of use, and robust feature set.
Using this Programming Software, you can Program (ATmega328 and ATmega8) microcontroller.

Memory:                                                                                                    Clock Speed:                                     Analog Inputs:
   ATmega328: 32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM, 1KB EEPROM              ATmega328: Up to 20 MHz           ATmega328: 8 channels
        ATmega8: 8KB Flash, 1KB SRAM, 512 bytes EEPROM          ATmega8: Up to 16 MHz               ATmega8: 6 channels

                                                                              PWM Outputs:            Operating Voltage:
                                                                                  ATmega328: 6              ATmega328: 1.8V to 5.5V
                                                                                       ATmega8: 3                  ATmega8: 2.7V to 5.5V

Architecture: Both microcontrollers use the 8-bit AVR architecture, which is designed for embedded systems.

Digital I/O Pins: Both have 23 digital I/O pins that can be configured as input or output.

Communication Interfaces: Both microcontrollers have USART, SPI, and I2C communication interfaces.

Timers/Counters: Each has 2x 8-bit timers/counters and 1x 16-bit timer/counter.

Power-Saving Modes: Both support multiple power-saving modes including Idle, ADC Noise Reduction, Power-save, Power-down,
  Standby, and Extended Standby.

Watchdog Timer: Both include a Watchdog Timer with a separate on-chip oscillator.

Programming: Both support In-System Programming (ISP) and high-voltage programming.

Brown-out Detection and Internal Oscillator: Both microcontrollers have brown-out detection and an internal 8 MHz calibrated oscillator.
