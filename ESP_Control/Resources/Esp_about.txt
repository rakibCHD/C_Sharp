The ESP8266 NodeMCU is a Wi-Fi based microcontroller board that is widely used for IoT (Internet of Things). The board is 
based on the ESP8266 chip,which integrates a microcontroller with a full TCP/IP stack and Wi-Fi capability, making it ideal 
for connecting devices to the internet.

Key Features:

    Wi-Fi Capability: The ESP8266 includes an integrated Wi-Fi transceiver, allowing it to connect to Wi-Fi networks and act 
    as either a client or an access point.

    Microcontroller: It has a 32-bit RISC CPU running at 80 MHz (can be overclocked to 160 MHz).

    Memory: It comes with 64 KB of instruction RAM, 96 KB of data RAM, and an external flash memory up to 4 MB.

    GPIO Pins: The NodeMCU board exposes several (GPIO) pins for interfacing with sensors and other devices.

    Programming: The board can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, MicroPython, or Lua, making it accessible to a wide 
    range of developers.

    Power: It operates at 3.3V and can be powered via USB or an external power source.
