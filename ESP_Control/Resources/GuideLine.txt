Firstly, you must have to upload a dedicated Bin file(ESP_With_C_Sharp.ino.nodemcu.bin) to communicate with your
ESP Board using this application.

Click the "Upload (.bin)" button.

If your ESP Board is already Connected, you will be asked to disconnect.

If your ESP Board is already Disconnected, stay disconnected.

Browse the necessary files (Programmer.exe, ESP_With_C_Sharp.ino.nodemcu.bin) properly.

Then click the "Find Port" button. A message will appear and ask you to connect your ESP Board within 30 seconds.

If you don't connect within the time limit, it will ask you to connect again.

After connecting properly, you will see the connected port. Click the "Flash" button.

It will flash the dedicated Bin file to your ESP Board.

You must select the output pin from the pin list.

Now you can operate the functions (On, Off, Blink).

You can also upload any Bin file for ESP.
