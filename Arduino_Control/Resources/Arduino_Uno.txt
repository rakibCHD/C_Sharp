Arduino Uno is a widely used microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. It's the most popular board in the 
Arduino family due to its simplicity and versatility.

Microcontroller: 
	Arduino Uno is powered by the ATmega328P microcontroller, which has 32KB of flash memory for storing code, 2KB of SRAM, 
	and 1KB of EEPROM.It has 16 MHz crystal oscillator to provide the clock signal for the microcontroller
Digital I/O Pins: 
	It has 14 digital input/output pins, of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs. 
Analog Inputs: 
	Arduino Uno has 6 analog input pins labeled A0 through A5, each of which can provide a 10-bit resolution (0-1023) analog input.
USB Connection: 
	Arduino Uno can be connected to a computer via USB. This connection is used for uploading sketches (programs) to the board and 
	for serial communication between the board and the computer.
Power Jack: 
	Arduino Uno can be powered via a DC power jack, which accepts voltages between 7V and 12V. It also has an onboard voltage
	regulator that regulates the voltage to 5V for the microcontroller and other components.
ICSP Header: 
	In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) header allows for programming the microcontroller with an external programmer if needed.
Reset Button: 
	Arduino Uno features a reset button, which can be pressed to reset the microcontroller.
Operating Voltage: 
	It operates at 5V, making it compatible with most sensors, actuators, and other electronic components.
Compatibility: 
	Arduino Uno is compatible with various shields, which are additional boards that can be plugged into the Arduino to extend
	its capabilities.
Open-Source: 
	Arduino Uno is an open-source platform, which means the design files, schematics, and source code are freely available for 
	anyone to modify and distribute.
