Firstly, you have to upload a dedicated HEX file to communicate with your Arduino Board using this application.

Click the "Upload (.hex)" button.

If your Arduino Board is already Connected, you will be asked to disconnect.

If your Arduino Board is already Disconnected, stay disconnected.

Browse the necessary files (Avrdude.exe, Avrdude.conf, Arduino_With_C_Sharp.ino.standard.hex) properly.

Then click the "Find Port" button. A message will appear and ask you to connect your Arduino Board within 20 seconds.
If you don't connect within the time limit, it will ask you to connect again.

After connecting properly, you will see the connected port. Click the "Flash" button.
It will flash the dedicated HEX file to your Arduino Board.

You must select the output pin from the pin list.

Now you can operate the functions (On, Off).

You can also upload any HEX file for Arduino, but remember that whenever you try to control the functions (On, Off),
you must upload the dedicated (Arduino_With_C_Sharp.ino.standard.hex) file first.
